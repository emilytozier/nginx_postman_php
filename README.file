This is an example taken from Dockerhub using the postman/newman_alpine33 image:

docker run -t postman/newman_alpine33 run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/8a0c9bc08f062d12dcda

This command will run a basic collection that sends a few requests to httpbin and performs some checks. This example is used to show you the collection running using the Docker Image and what the output is in the terminal.
You should run docker-compose up
and then go to localhost:8080
